<h5 id="assembly-is-a-human-readable-form-of-machine-code">Assembly is a human readable form of machine code.</h5>

<ul>
  <li>Assembly has 2 syntaxes: “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax “Intel” has nothing to do with ‘Intel’ the hardware manufacturer company. <br />
The syntax “AT&amp;T” has nothing do with the American phone company. <br />
(These are just simply the names for the 2 available syntaxes). <br />
Another way of looking at this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>python2 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print "Hello World!"</code>. <br />
python3 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print("Hello World!")</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code snippets do the exact same thing, but the syntaxes are different. <br />
Same applies for assembly syntaxes “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every application is translated into machine code.</li>
</ul>

<p>Learning assembly will allow us to read any application. <br />
Which will allow us to understand exactly what every application is doing. <br />
When you know assembly, everything is open-sourced!</p>
