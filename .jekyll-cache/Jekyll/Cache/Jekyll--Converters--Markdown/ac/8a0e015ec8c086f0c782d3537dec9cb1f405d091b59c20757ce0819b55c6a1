I"]<p>Learning the basic concepts</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly is a human readable form of machine code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly has 2 syntaxes: “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.
The syntax “Intel” has nothing to do with ‘Intel’ the technology company
and the “AT&amp;T” syntax has nothing do with the American phone company.
These are just simply the names for the syntaxes available.
Another way of looking at this:
python2 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print "Hello World!"</code>.
python3 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print("Hello World!")</code>.
The code snippets do the exact same thing, but the syntaxes are different.
Same applies for assembly syntaxes “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.</p>
