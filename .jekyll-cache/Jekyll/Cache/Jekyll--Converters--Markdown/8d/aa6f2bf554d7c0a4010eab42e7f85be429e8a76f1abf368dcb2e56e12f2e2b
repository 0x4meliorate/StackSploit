<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly is a human readable form of machine code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly has 2 syntaxes: “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.</p>

    <p>The syntax “Intel” has nothing to do with ‘Intel’ the hardware manufacturering company. <br />
  The syntax “AT&amp;T” has nothing do with the American phone company. <br />
  (These are just simply the names for the 2 available syntaxes). <br />
  Another way of looking at this:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>python2 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print "Hello World!"</code>. <br />
python3 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print("Hello World!")</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The code snippets do the exact same thing, but the syntaxes are different. <br />
  Same applies for assembly syntaxes “Intel” and “AT&amp;T”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every application is translated into machine code.</p>

    <p>Learning assembly will allow us to read any application. <br />
  Which will allow us to understand exactly what every application is doing. <br />
  When you know assembly, everything is open-sourced!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Assembly has 3 main concepts. <br />
Instructions, Registers and the Stack. <br />
  I was writing this blog, but I got tired. <br />
  I will complete this tomorrow. :)</li>
