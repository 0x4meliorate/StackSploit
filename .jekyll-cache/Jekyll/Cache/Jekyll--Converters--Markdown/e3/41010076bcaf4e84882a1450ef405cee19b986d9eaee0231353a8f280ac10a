<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly is a human readable form of machine code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Assembly has 2 syntaxes: â€œIntelâ€ and â€œAT&amp;Tâ€.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax â€œIntelâ€ has nothing to do with â€˜Intelâ€™ the hardware manufacturer company
and the â€œAT&amp;Tâ€ syntax has nothing do with the American phone company.
These are just simply the names for the syntaxes available.
Another way of looking at this:
python2 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print "Hello World!"</code>.
python3 allows you to output to console using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print("Hello World!")</code>.
The code snippets do the exact same thing, but the syntaxes are different.
Same applies for assembly syntaxes â€œIntelâ€ and â€œAT&amp;Tâ€.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Every application is translated into machine code for the CPU to understand, learning assembly will allow us to read any application. Which will allow us to understand exactly what every application is doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When you know assembly, everything is open-sourced!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
